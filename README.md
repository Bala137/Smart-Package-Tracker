# Smart-Package-Tracker
Team Sparkles - IoT Hackthon at BITS PILANI

# Brief About the project

Nowadays, it becomes very difficult to track the package.
The idea we proposed is related to easy track of delivery vehicles with exact location via a single mobile location.
We have also deployed the item order page.

# Idealogy

A transmitter will be fixed into the delivery vehicles.
When a particular package is set out for delivery, the smart app will be updated with the details of the particular vehicle.
The transceiver will keep on updating its location to the smart application.
Users can easily track of their products.
With this smart application they can also calculate the shortest path between the vehicle and the final destination.
It is very much user-friendly.
